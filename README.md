# 📅 Daily Task Organizer

A simple, command-line productivity tool to help you track daily intentions versus actual outcomes.

## 🛠 Project Logic
This project focuses on the transition of tasks through two primary states:
1. **completed_tasks**: Items successfully finished.
2. **incomplete_tasks**: Items that still need attention.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone the repo**: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/daily-task-organizer.git`
2. **Run the script**: `python src/task_manager.py`

## 📝 Usage
- **Morning**: Input your tasks. Type `done` to finish the list.
- **Evening**: The script will prompt you for each task. Answer with `y` (yes) or `n` (no).
- **Summary**: Review your performance in the auto-generated summary table.
